# NC-Education

This repository contains a dataset that contains information from the 115 school districts in North Carolina. The dataset contains 32 variables, including the racial diversity
each school district's student population to the amount of funding the district receives, as well as where it comes from and how they allocate it. All information is taken from 
US News and World Report, with all information from the dataset being observed and recorded from 2018-2023 (the years reported may vary from each school district, but they all 
come from at most 7 years ago). Some information was gathered through surveys, but some information (like school spending and funds) was acquired from the government. 

Here are the definitions for the variables:
  
  School System:   
  - (Qualitative/Nominal)
  - The name of the school system (many of these are just the names of the NC county itself, but not all of them).

  - (Quantitative/Discrete)
  - The ratio of students to every one teacher (i.e. 14 means 14:1 students to teachers).

  Number of Schools:
  - (Quantitative/Discrete)
  - The number of schools that are in the school district

  Number of Students:
  - (Quantitative/Discrete)
  - The number of students who go to school in the district (numbers may not be entirely up-to-date 100% accurate)

  Total Minority Enrollment Percent:
  - (Quantitative/Discrete)
  - The number reflects the percent of the total studnet population that identifies as part of a minority (these have all been rounded up by US News and World Reports so they're all whole numbers, not my doing)

  Percent of White Students:
  - (Quantitative/Continuous)
  - The percentage of the total student population that identifies as white

  Percent of Black Students:
  - (Quantitative/Continuous)
  - The percentage of the total student population that identifies as black

  - The percentage of the total student population that identifies as native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander

  Economically Disadvantaged:
  - (Quantitative/Continuous)
  - The percentage of the student population that are eligible to participate in the federal free and reduced meal price (this means the student's family must have an income below poverty guidelines- for example, for 2021 (when some of the data was gathered) the poverty guideline was set by multiplying 1.3 by the 2021 Federal Income and rounding up to the next whole dollar).

  Average Percent of Certified Teachers:
  - (Quantitative/Continuous)
  - The percentage of the district's teachers who have met the state's requirements by undergoing EPP (Educator Preparation Program), passing tests, and having a background check. In North Carolina, a bachelor's degree is a minimum requirement. Unlicensed teachers are allowed to teach under specific circumstances, like alternate licensure programs or in the case of emergency. Unlicensed teachers may also be working towards getting a license.

  Number of Full-Time Counselors:
  - (Quantitative/Discrete)
  - The number of school counselors working full-time in the district.

  High School College Readiness:

  High/Middle/Elementary School Math/Reading Proficiency:
  - (Quantitative/Discrete)
  - The reading/math End-of-Course test scores of the school district

  Total Revenue:
