# NC-Education

This repository contains a dataset that contains information from the 115 school districts in North Carolina. The dataset contains 32 variables, including the racial diversity
each school district's student population to the amount of funding the district receives, as well as where it comes from and how they allocate it. All information is taken from 
US News and World Report, with all information from the dataset being observed and recorded from 2018-2023 (the years reported may vary from each school district, but they all 
come from at most 7 years ago). Some information was gathered through surveys, but some information (like school spending and funds) was acquired from the government.
