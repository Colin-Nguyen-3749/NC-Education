# NC-Education

This repository contains a dataset that contains information from the 115 school districts in North Carolina collected from late June to early July of 2025. The dataset contains 32 variables, including the racial diversity
each school district's student population to the amount of funding the district receives, as well as where it comes from and how they allocate it. All information is taken from 
US News and World Report, with all information from the dataset being observed and recorded from 2018-2023 (the years reported may vary from each school district, but they all 
come from at most 7 years ago). Some information was gathered through surveys, but some information (like school spending and funds) was acquired from the government. 

Data sourced from publicly available information on usnews.com. This project is for educational and non-commercial purposes only.


Here are the definitions for the variables:

| Variable Name | Data Type | Definition |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
|School System|(Qualitative/Nominal)|The name of the school system (many of these are just the names of the NC county itself, but not all of them)|
|Student-Teacher Ratio (to every 1 teacher)|(Quantitative/Discrete)|The ratio of students to every one teacher (i.e. 14 means 14:1 students to teachers)|
| Number of Schools|(Quantitative/Discrete)|The number of schools that are in the school district|
|Number of Students|(Quantitative/Discrete)|The number of students who go to school in the district (numbers may not be entirely up-to-date 100% accurate)|
|Total Minority Enrollment Percent|(Quantitative/Discrete)| The number reflects the percent of the total student population that identifies as part of a minority (these have all been rounded up by US News and World Reports so they're all whole numbers, not my doing)|
|Percent of White\Black\Hispanic\Asian\Two or More Races\American Indian\Alaska Native\Native Hawaiian\Pacific Islander Students|(Quantitative/Continuous)|The percentage of the total student population that identifies as White\Black\Hispanic\Asian\Two or More Races\American Indian\Alaska Native\Native Hawaiian\Pacific Islander|
|Economically Disadvantaged|(Quantitative/Continuous)|The percentage of the student population that are eligible to participate in the federal free and reduced meal price (this means the student's family must have an income below poverty guidelines- for example, for 2021 (when some of the data was gathered) the poverty guideline was set by multiplying 1.3 by the 2021 Federal Income and rounding up to the next whole dollar)|
|Average Percent of Certified Teachers|(Quantitative/Continuous)|The percentage of the district's teachers who have met the state's requirements by undergoing EPP (Educator Preparation Program), passing tests, and having a background check. In North Carolina, a bachelor's degree is a minimum requirement. Unlicensed teachers are allowed to teach under specific circumstances, like alternate licensure programs or in the case of emergency. Unlicensed teachers may also be working towards getting a license|

|High/Middle/Elementary School Math/Reading Proficiency|(Quantitative/Discrete)|The reading/math End-of-Course test scores of the school district|
|Total Revenue|(Quantitative/Discrete)|The amount of money that the school receives annually|
|Revenue per Student| (Quantitative/Discrete)|The amount of revenue that the district receives for each enrolled student (total revenue/number of students)|
|Total Current Expenses| (Quantitative/Discrete)|The total amount of expenses that the school has|
| Expenses per Student|(Quantitative/Discrete)|The amount of funding that the school district spends to educate a student on average each year|
|  State/Local/Federal Funding|(Quantitative/Continuous)|The percent of the district's funding that comes from state/local/federal sources|
|  Amount Spent on Instruction/Support Services/Other Expenses| (Quantitative/Continuous)|The amount (in millions of dollars) of the district's funding that goes towards instruction/support services (like tutoring/mentoring, learning assistance, alternative education, school nurses or social workers, etc.)/other expenses (probably like maintenance, school lunches, extracurriculars)|
